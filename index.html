         <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
         <p>Created in 1993 by Tim Berners-Lee, HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. But what is a markup language? Well, this just means that HTML uses tags to mark up content and provide structure for web pages.Despite being around for three decades, HTML is always evolving, and the most current version is HTML5, which was released in 2014. This was a big step forward for HTML, as it introduced new features like semantic tags and audio and video support.In 2023, HTML is one of the key components of the modern Internet, and it tends to be used alongside web dev technologies like CSS and JavaScript. With this combination, web developers can create rich and interactive web pages, web applications, and other web development projects.The exponential rise in mobile devices and increasing importance for accessibility has also helped HTML to remain relevant, as proper use of HTML tags and attributes can make websites accessible to all users while also making them easy to view on all types of devices.</p>
